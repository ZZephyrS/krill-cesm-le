Copepods in the winter = krill growth

#### From SCAR Abstract Process: 2/24/2020
In this study we use a large ensemble ecosystem model as a framework to explicitly make the separation between drivers of ecosystem variability and attribute variations in krill habitat to naturally varying processes versus forced change. 
    = consider exploring this in your analysis, attempting to explain, for instance, the interannual to decadal variability in the model by variations in sea ice or wind stress, for instance.
